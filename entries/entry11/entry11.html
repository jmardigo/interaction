    <span class="cA">it was one hundred degrees</span>
    <span class="cB">as we sat beneath a willow tree</span>
    <span class="cC">whose tears didn't care, they just hung in the air</span>
    <span class="cD">and refused to fall, to fall</span>
    <span class="cA">and i knew i'd made a horrible call</span>
    <span class="cB">and now the state line felt like the berlin wall</span>
    <span class="cC">and there was no doubt about which side i was on</span>
    <span class="cD">'cause i built you a home in my heart</span>
    <span class="cA">with rotten wood and it decayed from the start</span>
    <span class="cB">'cause you can't find nothing at all</span>
    <span class="cC">if there was nothing there all along</span>
    <span class="cD">no, you can't find nothing at all</span>
    <span class="cA">if there was nothing there all along</span>
    <span class="cB">i braved treacherous streets</span>
    <span class="cC">and kids strung out on homemade speed</span>
    <span class="cD">and we shared a bed in which i could not sleep at all</span>
    <span class="cA">'cause at night, the sun in retreat</span>
    <span class="cB">made the skyline look like crooked teeth</span>
    <span class="cC">in the mouth of a man who was devouring </span>
    <span class="cD">us both</span>
